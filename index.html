                            <p class="news__item_text">Free directories: directories are perfect for customers that
                                are...
                                searching for a particular topic. What’s great about them is that you only have to post
                                once
                                and
                                they are good for long periods of time. It saves a lot of your time when you don’t have
                                to
                                resubmit your information every week or every month. The bad news is most of your
                                traffic
                                won’t
                                come from here. I still feel it is worth it to get your link out there. Just take one
                                day
                                and
                                set it aside for posting to free directories. You won’t need to do it again for at least
                                6
                                months.

                                2. Classified Ads: These are great for work from home businesses. Think about it. Where
                                do
                                people go when they are looking for a job? That’s right-the classifieds. The only
                                downside
                                to
                                classified ads is that you have to resubmit them quite frequently. Once you find which
                                classifieds bring you the most traffic you can concentrate on them and weed the others
                                out.
                                So
                                it is really more time consuming in the beginning, and doesn’t have to be later on when
                                you
                                get
                                the hang of things.

                                3. Free article submissions/ezines: The best way to inform others about your product or
                                service
                                is to write an article about it. In your authors resource box, you can tell readers
                                about
                                yourself and where they can go to check out your product or service. This is also an
                                excellent
                                way to get free links to your site if you have one. There are a lot of webmasters out
                                there
                                who
                                are looking for good articles they can post on their site. If they post yours, that is
                                another
                                site that is doing the advertising for you. All for free.

                                4. URL Submissions: Probably the quickest and easiest thing to do to advertise your
                                site.
                                Just
                                type “Free URL submission” in your search engine. When you get a list just enter the URL
                                you
                                are
                                promoting and click submit. That’s it. It only takes a few seconds and your done. Just
                                set a
                                day
                                aside once every 3 months and do this.

                                5. Forum Posts: Put your product or service website in your signature file when you sign
                                up
                                on
                                some forums. It will be displayed every time you make a post. Try to look for topics
                                that
                                you
                                have some knowledge on, and can give a relevant answer too. Do not spam anyone, you will
                                get
                                kicked off the forum and you will get a bad reputation. Get involved asking and
                                answering
                                questions that pertain to your area of business. Forums are great because once you make
                                a
                                post
                                it stays there forever. It will get moved to the archives eventually, but someone could
                                still
                                find it if they were searching the archives. Yes, there are many people who do.

                                6. Traffic Exchanges: Probably the most time consuming way to advertise for free, but
                                definately
                                the most effective. Most forums I have visited have said in many posts that they
                                received a
                                lot
                                of their profit from traffic exchanges. If you don’t want to spend the time surfing for
                                credits,
                                you do have the option of buying them. I would look into a program that lets you surf
                                multiple
                                websites at once like crazy browser. There are others and they are free to download.
                                That
                                way
                                you can just spend one hour a day and get all your surfing in at once.

                                7. News-groups: Become involved in a group that has to do with your kind of business.
                                You
                                can
                                usually mail the group once per day, but I would encourage you to find something fresh
                                to
                                talk
                                about each day. People will tune you out if they see the same message all the time.
                                Remember
                                to
                                never Spam anyone. Only join groups with the same interests as yours. In other words,
                                don’t
                                sign
                                up for a recipe swapping group when you are advertising shaving cream.</p>

                            <p class="news__item_text">There are many things that are important to catalog design....
                                Your images must be sharp and appealing. Your text and even the font you use for the
                                text is
                                important. The cover page design and the design of your catalog’s product pages all play
                                important roles in designing a catalog that will bring in new customers and sales.

                                However none of the things mentioned above are more important than the type of paper you
                                will
                                choose to print your catalog on. The “feel” of your catalog is important to your
                                potential
                                customers. The longer they have your catalog in their hands, the more product they will
                                buy.
                                In
                                this article I will go over some of the many paper choices you have to print your
                                catalog
                                on.

                                First you need to decide if the cover will be the same paper as the rest of your
                                catalog. In
                                most cases the cover will be of heavier weight then the interior pages.

                                Second you will need to choose coated or uncoated paper for printing your catalog.
                                Coated
                                paper
                                is for the glossier layouts and uncoated is more economical, but can still display your
                                products
                                well.

                                So you have two things to consider first, “Will it be glossy paper or not?”, “Will my
                                cover
                                be
                                the same weight as the interior pages of my catalog?”

                                Once you have answered those two questions the next decision is what the weight of the
                                paper
                                will be. Most catalogs go with 60, 70, or 80 lb. weights. So it would be 60lb uncoated
                                or
                                coated, 70 lb. Coated or uncoated. 80 lb. Paper usually is only chosen for 80 lb. Weight
                                and
                                above. Also, not all paper is measured by weight. Some is measured by thickness or
                                “points”.

                                Now the above is really over-simplified. There are other types of special paper you can
                                choose
                                from. There is textured paper, photographic paper, and other more expensive paper to
                                choose
                                from
                                if you are selling a high-end or expensive product.

                                There are also other considerations when choosing the paper your catalog will be printed
                                on.
                                Such as the method of printing you are going to choose.

                                If you are going to have your catalog printed on a hot-set web press, then you can
                                choose
                                uncoated or coated paper. The heat will dry the ink as it prints your catalog. If your
                                printer
                                uses a cold-set web press then the ink air-dries and is absorbed into the paper. A
                                cold-set
                                web
                                press cannot print on coated paper.

                                If your printer uses a sheet-fed press then you can choose from any of the high quality
                                papers
                                they have available. The same goes for printers that do digital printing.

                                It will depend a lot on the printer you choose. You need to find out what type of paper
                                is
                                available and you will want to see samples of the paper to get a better idea of which
                                one
                                you
                                want to print your catalog on. Also ask your printer to suggest the different types of
                                paper
                                they think will be the best for your catalog.

                                Here is a list of some of the types of paper your printer may have available for you to
                                choose
                                from or may be able to order for you.

                                Dull Coated Paper

                                Matte Coated Paper

                                Glossy Coated Paper

                                Antique Paper

                                Vellum Paper

                                Wove Paper

                                Smooth Paper

                                Felt Paper

                                Linen Paper

                                Fiber-added Paper

                                Laid Paper

                                Parchment

                                Four things determine the quality of the paper, opacity, brightness, finish, and ppi.
                                (Pounds
                                per inch) Brightness affects the contrast and brilliance of the paper. It affects how
                                your
                                text
                                will stand out on the pages of your catalog. Opacity is how much your ink is visible
                                from
                                the
                                back of the page. If a paper is too opaque, your text and images from one page will be
                                seen
                                through onto another page that your customer is trying to read. The finish affects the
                                feel
                                of
                                the pages and also how your images will look. The lower grade finishes produce grainier
                                images
                                while high quality finishes sharpen the look of your images.

                                Ask your printer to provide you with samples or swatch booklets and a price list for
                                printing
                                your catalog on the various types of paper before you decide. You know what your budget
                                is
                                and
                                paper is only one of the expenses you have to consider.</p>

                                people go when they are looking for a job? That’s right-the classifieds. The only

                                to
                                classified ads is that you have to resubmit them quite frequently. Once you find which
                                classifieds bring you the most traffic you can concentrate on them and weed the others
                                out.
                                So
                                it is really more time consuming in the beginning, and doesn’t have to be later on when
                                you
                                get
                                the hang of things.

                                3. Free article submissions/ezines: The best way to inform others about your product or
                                service
                                is to write an article about it. In your authors resource box, you can tell readers
                                about
                                yourself and where they can go to check out your product or service. This is also an
                                excellent
                                way to get free links to your site if you have one. There are a lot of webmasters out
                                there
                                who
                                are looking for good articles they can post on their site. If they post yours, that is
                                another
                                site that is doing the advertising for you. All for free.

                                4. URL Submissions: Probably the quickest and easiest thing to do to advertise your
                                site.
                                Just
                                type “Free URL submission” in your search engine. When you get a list just enter the URL
                                you
                                are
                                promoting and click submit. That’s it. It only takes a few seconds and your done. Just
                                set a
                                day
                                aside once every 3 months and do this.

                                5. Forum Posts: Put your product or service website in your signature file when you sign
                                up
                                on
                                some forums. It will be displayed every time you make a post. Try to look for topics
                                that
                                you
                                have some knowledge on, and can give a relevant answer too. Do not spam anyone, you will
                                get
                                kicked off the forum and you will get a bad reputation. Get involved asking and
                                answering
                                questions that pertain to your area of business. Forums are great because once you make
                                a
                                post
                                it stays there forever. It will get moved to the archives eventually, but someone could
                                still
                                find it if they were searching the archives. Yes, there are many people who do.

                                6. Traffic Exchanges: Probably the most time consuming way to advertise for free, but
                                definately
                                the most effective. Most forums I have visited have said in many posts that they
                                received a
                                lot
                                of their profit from traffic exchanges. If you don’t want to spend the time surfing for
                                credits,
                                you do have the option of buying them. I would look into a program that lets you surf
                                multiple
                                websites at once like crazy browser. There are others and they are free to download.
                                That
                                way
                                you can just spend one hour a day and get all your surfing in at once.

                                7. News-groups: Become involved in a group that has to do with your kind of business.
                                You
                                can
                                usually mail the group once per day, but I would encourage you to find something fresh
                                to
                                talk
                                about each day. People will tune you out if they see the same message all the time.
                                Remember
                                to
                                never Spam anyone. Only join groups with the same interests as yours. In other words,
                                don’t
                                sign
                                up for a recipe swapping group when you are advertising shaving cream.</p>
