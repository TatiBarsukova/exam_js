                Increasing prosperity in our lives can be accomplished by having the right frame of mind.
                The truth is, our thoughts are very powerful.
                They are capable of influencing every aspect of our daily lives, from our physical health to
                our social behaviors. I’m sure you’ve heard the adage, “As you think, so shall you be.”

                If we want to improve our lives, we must first improve our thoughts. Harnessing the
                power of
                thought in a positive way has the ability to create great change in our lives, including
                our
                financial well-being and prosperity. But how? How do we take something as intangible as
                thoughts, and manifest them into a physical reality?

                We must first understand that being prosperous is more than having a lot of money.
                Prosperity is a mindset, a way of interacting in our lives, and a way of thinking.
                Mastering
                this train of thought is not easy, but it is simple enough if we keep working on it
                consistently.

                Following are some ideas to help you improve your thoughts, and ultimately attract more
                prosperity into your life:

                Be grateful for the blessings in your life right now. Take a few minutes each day to
                express
                heartfelt gratitude for the good things in your life. Even more powerful, write a few of
                these blessings down each day. This helps to put your focus in the right direction — on
                abundance, not lack.

                Use positive affirmations to begin training yourself to think positively. Use “I am”
                statements such as “I am worthy of all that is good.” Write the statements down and
                repeat
                them nightly before bed. Over time, this will implant these thoughts into your
                subconscious
                mind, and you will begin to naturally believe them.

                Creative visualization can help you achieve prosperity by determining what it is you
                wish to
                achieve, and then thoroughly creating that image in your mind. This works in the same
                way
                affirmations do. Our subconscious will fill with images of prosperity, and eventually
                these
                subconscious “truths” will manifest in the physical. “See” yourself as being prosperous,
                and
                you will become so.

                Encourage yourself with the belief that you can achieve great things. This could also be
                one
                of your affirmations, but expand on it. If you know you can earn a certain salary, tell
                yourself you can earn more. Allow yourself to believe all things are possible, and you
                will
                gain the confidence needed to reach higher than you ever imagined you could. If you
                believe
                you can do it, you are more likely to take the risks associated with people who are
                highly
                successful. Prosperity and success go hand in hand, so take risks and aim higher.

                Start a savings account. As strange as it sounds, think about this: Like Attracts Like.
                Even
                if you can only afford to put a few dollars into your account every month, it will begin
                to
                build up and attract more money.

                Finally, believe you are already wealthy. The creative ability of our thoughts is such
                that
                we lend more power and energy to whatever we consistently focus on. Focusing on lack
                will
                create more lack. Focusing on wealth and prosperity will create . . . guess what?

                Remember that this is a process. You likely won’t change your circumstances in one day.
                But
                over time, with consistent focus, your thoughts will begin to attract what you want.
                Once
                you master this power of thought, there are truly no limits to what you can create!
